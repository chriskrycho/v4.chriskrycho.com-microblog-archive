<i class=editorial>I originally posted this as a [tweetstorm], but I'm treating *this* as the canonical and adding a tweet to the end of that "topic" linking back here. [Indie web] forever.</i>

Remember to find little ways to say thanks for the F/OSS you use. It doesn't have to be a lot‚Äîeven a small gesture goes a long ways.

E.g.: I just sent a ‚òïÔ∏è or üç∫ worth of the August New Rustacean [Patreon] funds to the awesome maintainer of the [intellijidea-emberjs] plugin.

That doesn‚Äôt begin to pay back the value he‚Äôs provided for me and many others---but even so, I know from experience: a little gesture is nice.
