- [AsciiDoc]: a typical programmer-first, not writer-first, tool. Just try to find text formatting on [the site][AsciiDoc]. It's ยง10 in the user guide. ยง10!

[AsciiDoc]: http://asciidoc.org

- The "user guide" is an *implementor's* guide, not a *user's* guide. <i>:sigh:</i>

- Gladly, [asciidoctor.org][asciidoctor] makes it easier: "What is AsciiDoc" and "Writer's Guide" and "Syntax Reference" are all on the front page.

- But if you've ever wondered why Markdown caught on and AsciiDoc didn't... well, there are many reasons, but this highlights the most basic: Markdown prioritizes the needs of the *writer*, not the implementor. Plain and simple as that.
