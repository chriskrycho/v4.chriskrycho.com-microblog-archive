<i class=editorial>I originally posted this as a [tweetstorm], but I'm treating *this* as the canonical and adding a tweet to the end of that "topic" linking back here. [Indie web] forever.</i>

- Trying to get set up with [Jamon Holmgren] to live-stream some pair-programming.

    This is *not* a solved problem. Good grief.

- Final solution (so far) includes *both* Screenhero *and* Hangouts on Air. :headdesk:

- That got us most of the way there; now weâ€™re actually using Hangouts+Zoom. This. is. bonkers.
