<i class=editorial>I originally posted this as a [tweetstorm], but I'm treating *this* as the canonical and adding a tweet to the end of that "topic" linking back here. [Indie web] forever.</i>

- I’ve spent the last couple weeks using [VS Code] instead of [Atom]. It has a lot of things to recommend it, especially speed. It’s fast.

- However, I have to say: it’s painfully obvious to me on macOS that Code is developed by people who *aren’t* Mac-native. Atom is.

- And that’s okay—but it means that as many things as I like about Code over Atom, it always just feels a little *off* to me.

- Ultimately, what I want is the extensibility promised by both Code and Atom, but with actually native UIs and native performance.

- So on that note… [\@raphlinus], how’s XiEditor coming along? Because its approach is what we all really want, I think.
