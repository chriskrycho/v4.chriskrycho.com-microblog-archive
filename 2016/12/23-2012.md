I keep trying to read documentation about templating engines in Rust and getting distracted by e.g. restyling [rustdoc] output.

[rustdoc]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/documentation.html#about-rustdoc

(That’s not a thing that’s happening, though I’d happily chip in if it were, just a thing that distracted me. Web Inspector.)
