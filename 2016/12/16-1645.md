- JavaScript experiences which induce profound frustration in me:

- I had gotten in an insane state where things just *stopped working* that had previously been working as I updated to [Ember CLI] 2.6.

- After much tearing of hair, I started over from scratch and repeated the upgrade process.

    Everything works now.

    ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

- Then: `rm -rf node_modules bower_components` and test again.

    Nothing works now.

    ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

- Consistently, it works fine after the upgrade and `ember init` finishes. Then, if I do a clean install of the dependencies, it fails.

- And it fails in the *same ways*. So ultimately I’ll be chasing those, because we’re not going to get stuck here.

- But this is an *infuriating* experience. If you’ve ever believed npm’s claim that non-deterministic installs aren’t a problem... consider this a data point in the opposite direction.
