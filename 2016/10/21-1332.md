<i class=editorial>I originally posted this as a [tweetstorm], but I'm treating *this* as the canonical and adding a tweet to the end of that "topic" linking back here. [Indie web] forever.</i>

- My online writing needs are weird. I have searched for years, and unfortunately… I need to write a custom CMS.

    ![](http://reactiongif.org/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/12/Darth-Vader-NOOO-GIF.gif "NOOOOOOOO!")

- I thought briefly about hammering together what I need with Metalsmith.io and its plugins. But that would be a stopgap.

- So the inevitable comes to pass: I commit to, however slowly, build the CMS I need.

    Probably in Rust—so it should be crazy fast.

- If you want to follow along on this site generator/CMS adventure (it’ll move slowly), you can do so [here](https://github.com/chriskrycho/lightning-rs).[^original]

- Status: looking at C bindings for Pandoc and thinking about implementing a Rust wrapper for libpandoc vs. shelling out to pandoc. 🤔

- First pass: just going to shell out on the command line. Second pass… well, if speed is what I’m going for…

- I’ve guessed this for a while, but I can confirm it now: [Clap](https://clap.rs) is a *really* fantastic command-line argument library.



[^original]: For posterity's sake (ha!) it's worth note that the original link here was to `yassg-btwir` not `lightning-rs`. I actually noted as much, writing:

    > That repo name is for “Yet Another Static Site Generator (This One’s In Rust)” because I feel *so* creative today.

    Note the headdesk-worthy initialism failure: it should have been `btoir` not `btwir`. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
