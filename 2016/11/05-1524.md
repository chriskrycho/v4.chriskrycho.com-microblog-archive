Pro tip: use `Map` and not `Object` for dictionaries/hash-tables in JavaScript. Performance difference is A LOT. (I haven’t measured, but for a simple example I was playing with (~12k items) it was at least a couple orders of magnitude.)

**Edit:** Belay that: the problem was an allocation-speed issue: I wasn’t reallocating a `Map`. Updating in-place is much more comparable.
