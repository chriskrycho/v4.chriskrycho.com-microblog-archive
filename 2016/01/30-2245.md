*Actually* cleaning up my desk areaâ€”because I (a) got a new desk and (b) am
getting a new 5k iMac this week. Current analysis suggests that I've received
two USB cables, one Ethernet cable, and one VGA cable for every device I've ever
purchased. Why in the world did I bring these cables here from Oklahoma three
