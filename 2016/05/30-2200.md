- Was able to write some Rust for myself (not just to figure something out for [New Rustacean]) for the first time in months tonight.
- Feeling Rust under my fingertips again was really nice but (pun fully intended) I am *so* rusty right now.
- But of course that’s just life. I’ve written gobs of JavaScript for work, of course, but the *only* non-work writing I’ve done has been actual writing of the "uses words and not just as keywords" variety.
- So it was nice to write some Rust for fun tonight. Even if it took me a ridiculously long time to do something super simple.
