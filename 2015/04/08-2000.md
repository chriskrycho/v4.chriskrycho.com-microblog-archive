For a class this year, I had to subscribe to a Baptist state paper. I picked the
North Carolina paper, the _Biblical Recorder_. The experience of the "digital
paper" is awful. It's basically scans in a copy-protected container---as
un-web-native as can be. These things need to improve, or they'll die in the
next generation.
