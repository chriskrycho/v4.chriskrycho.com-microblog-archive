Here’s someone else [making one of the same points][link] I made last week about the indie web---but much more succinctly!

 >Oh man, I wrote a blog post only to find out later that <a href="https://twitter.com/chriskrycho">\@chriskrycho</a> has written a much better version of it... ["Even With a cool domain name, RSS-Powered Micro Blogging Is Still a Mirage"][link]

My only real disagreement with [\@Beirutspring] there is that I think (and hope) there’s room for centralized services *and* the open web.
